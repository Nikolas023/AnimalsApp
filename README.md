# AnimalsApp 
Basic app where you click on an animal to reveal a fun fact! This project was made from a tutorial in this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-android-app-development-from-scratch-with-java/
I modified the description of the animals to have a fact about them.

# What I Learned
* Developed a user interface within the xml file using TextView, RecyclerView, LinearLayout, and CardView.
* Implemented functionality to UI: onCreate, onCreateViewHolder, onBindViewHolder, onItemClick and more.

# How To Use The App
1) Type "install" in the search bar in your settings on your Android device. Look for a setting called "Install unknown apps" or something similar.
2) You can check off a browser (like Chrome or Edge) in order to download the file onto your phone.
3) Once you have the file you should be able to open it and use it.

If you're on a computer, you can download the file and put it on your Google drive, then access the file on your Android device from the Google drive app.
